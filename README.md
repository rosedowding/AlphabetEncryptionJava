Also created in late 2020, this project is a Java port of my C# Alphabet Encryption. It uses a hard-coded cipher to "encrypt" the user's message. As with my C# project, it is not secure, and was created more so as a proof-of-concept that test my early programming skills, as well as being a way to teach myself Java.

I created two versions of this project. The first only allowed encryption, whilst the second allowed decryption.
